##### Question 1
One benefit is that it is (somewhat) user friendly. Once it is all set up, you simply need to make the content and push the changes to the website. You don't need to manually make the site itself with all the links, connections, and so forth. 

One downside is that it isn't very flexible. As far as I know, it only seems to make static HTML pages. Plus, it makes the HTML for you, so if you want to make any minute changes for individual pages, you would need to do that manually. 

As far as I know, the implementation of the website is largely hidden. A lot of the actual "structure" is on the creation device (local computer, external server, etc.). On the actual GitHub repo, it puts all the HTML files on the root directory, despite the content files being in a separate folder on the creation device. (I'm pretty sure it can make more advanced file hierarchy structures on the actual server hosting the website, but it still stands that the actual structure of the website is substantially different than what appears on your computer.)

And I guess you don't really learn how websites really work doing this method. But thjat also applies to website makers like Squarespace, or programs like Wordpress.
